# Theming
gruvbox, a theme using pastel 'retro groove' colors.
[https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox] and [https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material]

## KDE Theming
The Global Theme is Breeze Dark. The Plasma style, colors, and icons are from the GruvboxPlasma theme. The rest of the appearance is Breeze Dark defaults.
### Panel
Used to use Latte Dock, but now only use a single top plasma panel. Use the fullscreen application launcher in left corner, event calendar widget in center, and center tray on right.
