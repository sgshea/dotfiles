## Current Installation
OS: Arch Linux
Host: ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6
- i7-1165G7
- Iris Xe Graphics
- 32 GB Ram
- 1 TB SSD
- 1920x1200 Touchscreen

# Theming
gruvbox, a theme using pastel 'retro groove' colors.
[https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox] and [https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material]

## KDE Theming
The Global Theme is Breeze Dark. The Plasma style, colors, and icons are from the GruvboxPlasma theme. The rest of the appearance is Breeze Dark defaults.
The SDDM login screen uses the "Slice" theme.
### Panel
Panel is using latte panel. There are 3 panels on top of the main screen, and one dock on the lower right set to autohide.
As latte supports exporting layouts, it is easier to import to new installs compared to replicating default plasma panels.
